# Java-Main-Method
Here it tells that java contains a string array type variable named as 'args' in which we can pass any values and use them later.
In this program 
i have stored values in args through compiler 'IntelliJ IDEA' .
the program will get the length of the string array and run till the length of it
and print the stored values in the array one by one.
